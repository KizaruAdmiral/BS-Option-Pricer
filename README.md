# What is a Black-Scholes model?
Developed in 1973 by Fischer Black, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes, the Black-Scholes model was the first widely used mathematical method to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract. To calculate an option's theoretical value using the Black-Scholes model, we need to know the below FIVE characteristics of the option and its underlying contract:
  1. The option's exercise price
  2. The time remaining to expiration
  3. The current price of the underlying contract
  4. The applicable interest rate over the life of the option
  5. The volatility of the underlying contract
